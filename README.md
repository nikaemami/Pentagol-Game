# Pentagol-Game
Implementing a newer version of the Pentago game in command line and graphical interface.

You may have heard the name of the game Pentago. This game is a 2-player board game, in which each person has a set of game pieces and the game board is 6 x 6. Any player who can place 5 pieces in a line will win the game. The game board is divided into 4 squares of 3 by 3 and each player, in his turn, must place a piece on the board and must also choose one of these 4 squares (independent of which one the piece is placed in), rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise, and then it will be the second player's turn. As mentioned, the game continues until a player can place 5 pieces in a line, horizontal, vertical or to place it obliquely, unless the game board is full and no player wins.


The only difference between Pentagole and Pentago is that instead of placing 5 pieces in a line, they should be moved in a form similar to the movement of a horse (4 pieces in a line and one to the right or left of the last piece) in chess. Here They can also be placed horizontally, vertically or obliquely. Note that the horse's movement differs from the letter L in that the horse can move in both directions, right or left (like this
Ë© or L) to move. The rest of the rules and conditions for ending the game are the same as before.


The game starts with the turn of the first player called b. This player, by entering a number (which represents the house selected from the screen), determines the placement of his piece. After placing the piece, this player is allowed to rotate one of the big squares. Now the necessary changes must be made on the game screen. Then the turn of the first player is over and it is the turn of the second player. The game continues in the same way until all the locations of the pieces are filled, or one of the players can meet the winning conditions. At the end, the winner of the game is determined by displaying a suitable message.

This problem is implemented both in the command line environment, and in the graphical interface. The game environment should be as below:
